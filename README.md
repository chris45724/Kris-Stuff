# Kris' Stuff

A generalized repository of small projects I like to work on. This repository also contains school stuff.
This repository will not be organized

## Directory

- [Projects](/Projects/projects.md)
  
- [School Stuff](/School-Stuff/school.md)

## Ideas

nothing here...

## File types

- .tsh: Trash file. Probably a text file
- .tmp: Temp files to be ignored
- .test: are any text file that is used in testing, also ignored by git

most files that are defined are for me to add to the gitignore

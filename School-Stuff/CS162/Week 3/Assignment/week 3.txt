Sentence Capitalizer:
Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument and capitalizes the first character of each sentence in the string. 
For instance, if the string argument is "hello. my name is Joe. what is your name?" 
the function should manipulate the string so that it contains "Hello. My name is Joe. What is your name?" 
Demonstrate the function in a program that asks the user to input a string then passes it to the function. 
The modified string should be displayed on the screen. 
Optional Exercise: Write an overloaded version of this function that accepts a string class object as its argument. 




10)

replaceSubstring Function:
Write a function named replaceSubstring. 
The function should accept three C-string or string object arguments. 
Let’s call them string1, string2, and string3. 
It should search string1 for all occurrences of string2. 
When it finds an occurrence of string2, it should replace it with string3. 
For example, suppose the three arguments have the following values:

string1:	“the dog jumped over the fence”
string2: 	“the”
string3:	“that”

With these three arguments, the function would return a string object with the value “that dog jumped over that fence.” 
Demonstrate the function in a complete program.



16)
Pig Latin:
Write a program that reads a sentence as input and converts each word to “Pig Latin.” 
In one version, to convert a word to Pig Latin, you remove the first letter and place that letter at the end of the word. 
Then you append the string “ay” to the word. Here is an example:

English: I SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT
Pig Latin: IAY LEPTSAY OSTMAY FOAY HETAY IGHTNAY
